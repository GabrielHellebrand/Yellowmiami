Gabriel Hellebrand – “user manual”

What is your style?
On the personality quiz I got INTJ which tells me I’m an architect. Looking at the strengths and weaknesses of the INTJ some of them are spot on while others are 
pretty different from me. I do see myself as determined and ambitious but while I’m not a social butterfly I’m not exactly clueless with social situations 
like what seems to be a trait of people who are INTJ. 
I am motivated by if what I’m doing will accomplish something that I’ll enjoy or if others will enjoy it. For example, I love movies but I have the problem of scrolling 
through Netflix for an hour or so trying to find something to watch so as a way to minimize endlessly scrolling through streaming apps. I’ll try to develop a list of 
movies I like or want to watch and use a random number generator to decide what I should watch next.

What do you value?
Competence - I love it when people including myself are competent for the task at hand. For instance, you don’t want a group of people where one person knows what 
they’re doing and everyone else is lost and confused.
Efficiency- Hard work is great but it doesn’t mean a lot if you aren’t efficient with your time and resources.
Honesty- I like it when people are honest with each other it makes working with people as well as life in general a lot easier.

When is the best time to approach you?
I like it best when I work in the mornings or early afternoon, this is best because that’s when my brain is the most awake and able to work the most efficiently. 
At night and later in the day, my brain’s worn out so I’m unfortunately not able to think as clearly as I do early in the morning. 

How do you like people to communicate with you?
Preferably I like to talk with people face to face rather than by text, phone or email. Texting’s fine but I don’t check incoming texts very much. Same goes for 
email, except that’s way worse. I think I have like 5,000 unopened messages for my Gmail because of spam and neglect. Talking to people on the phone especially 
people I don’t know can be uncomfortable because it can be hard to remember what to say. 

How do you make decisions?
I can be extremely indecisive at times so I’ll flip a coin or I’ll just go with the option that’s most convenient the majority of the time. 
For example, trying to pick a movie to watch can be difficult.

What do people misunderstand about me?
I smile a lot so people think I’m always happy when this isn’t always the case. I’m generally a pretty happy person though so it’s not so bad. 
This is the opposite of other people I know who have an angry resting face when there not very angry people. One of my roommates theorized that I smile when 
I’m thinking hard about something and he might be right but I don’t know. I don’t know if there’s anything else that people misunderstand about me.

How can people help you?
I’m not the most persistent person in the world. When say homework or anything really doesn’t go the way I want it to go I tend to give up easily. 
I’m much better at not doing this than in the past but it’s something I still need to work on. Other than that, I don’t know with anything specific.
